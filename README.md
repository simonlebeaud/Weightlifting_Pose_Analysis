# Weightlifting pose analysis

This repository is meant to solve a problem I have seen in crossfit open and semifinals.  
Each individual has to film him/herself for each stage of the competition. Each video is then analysed.  
Moreover many people on social media have shown that even if a referee is there to count each rep of the athletes, some athlete dont have the perfect form but the reps are counted anyway.  
As a crossfit athlete myself (and not a great one) it is frustrating to watch uncompleted reps be counted as valid.  
This is why I started working on this project.  
This project aim to use Pose detection to see if we can validate reps on videos following a number of reps.
